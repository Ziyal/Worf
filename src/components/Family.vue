    <h1>Family</h1>
    <p>Worf was born in 2340 on the Klingon homeworld, Qo'noS, as the son of Mogh, patriarch of one of the Klingon Empire's Great Houses. When Worf was five years old, his father took him and his mother to live on the Khitomer colony. (TNG: "Sins of the Father") There, Mogh took Worf on a ritual hunt along with a garrison warrior, L'Kor. Worf had not yet reached the Age of Inclusion and was barely able to hold a bat'leth. During the hunt, Worf was mauled by a beast, leaving behind a scar and memory he kept throughout his life.</p>

    <p>In 2346, the Klingon Empire and the Romulan Star Empire were officially allied but a conspiracy between the Romulans and the House of Duras left the Klingon Empire open to betrayal. Romulan forces attacked the Khitomer colony, killing nearly all the 4,000 Klingon colonists, including Worf's parents.</p>

    <p>Worf dated K'Ehleyr, a Human-Klingon woman, while he attended Starfleet Academy, but the relationship at the time ended acrimoniously. In 2365, while K'Ehleyr served as a Klingon emissary, she had to board the Enterprise-D to deal with a Klingon sleeper ship from the 23rd century. The two briefly rekindled their relationship when a joint holodeck training exercise led to a Klingon mating ritual. Worf, at the time, insisted that they take the oath of marriage afterward, but K'Ehleyr refused, stating, "Don't give me any of that Klingon nonsense." K'Ehleyr paid no heed to Klingon tradition, as she felt that she had inherited the worst traits of her respective parents' races (her Human mother's sense of humor, and her Klingon father's temper). They parted afterward, resolving their feelings before her departure from the Enterprise-D.</p>

    <p>Unbeknownest to Worf, however, the mating ritual led to K'Ehleyr becoming pregnant with their child. K'Ehleyr returned to the Enterprise-D in 2367 to participate in the succession of Chancellor K'mpec, and took the opportunity to introduce their son, Alexander, to Worf for the first time. In the intervening years, she found she needed Worf after all, and wanted to finish the mating ritual. This time, Worf backed off, unwilling to permit his intervening discommendation to discredit either K'Ehleyr or Alexander. Worf's refusal to detail the nature of his discommendation prompted K'Ehleyr to start her own investigation, an action that triggered the attention of Duras and her subsequent murder. Worf and Alexander found K'Ehleyr dying from multiple stab wounds. Her whisper confirmed the identity of her killer, and she brought Alexander's small hand to his father's as she died.</p>

    <p>Worf performed the Klingon death ritual and consoled his son in Klingon fashion before he abandoned the symbols of Starfleet and Empire. With only his bat'leth, he boarded Duras' ship, the IKS Vorn, claiming the Right of Vengeance under Klingon law. After the first blows were exchanged, Duras reminded Worf the cost of victory â€“ Duras' death meant Worf's family name may never be cleared. Worf's family name suddenly meant little against the memory of K'Ehleyr, and he answered, "Then that is how it shall be!" and left Duras' corpse on the deck.</p>
